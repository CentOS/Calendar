## Meeting schedule

The IRC meetings schedule is driven by the [github.com/CentOS/Calendar](https://github.com/CentOS/Calendar) repository.  To propose a change or add a meeting, please submit a pull-request to that github repository.  This repository is mirrored to git.centos.org.

The calendar is also available as an `.ical` file containing all CentOS IRC meetings, for use in your favorite calendaring app: [iCalendar Meeting Schedule](/community/irc-meetings.ical)

Note that you should *subscribe* to this link, rather than *import* it,
because it is subject to change.

A [list of all meetings](#list) is available below.

## Logging

CentOS IRC channels and meetings are often logged using a [https://wiki.centos.org/SIGGuide#SIGGuide.2FSIGProcess.2FDailyWorkings.Meetbot_Commands](meeting bot), for the purpose of taking minutes.
You can find meeting minutes [here](http://www.centos.org/minutes/).
