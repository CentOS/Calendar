## Meeting schedule

The IRC meetings schedule is driven by the [github.com/CentOS/Calendar](https://github.com/CentOS/Calendar) repository.  To propose a change or add a meeting, please submit a pull-request to that github repository.  This repository is mirrored to git.centos.org.

The calendar is also available as an `.ical` file containing all CentOS IRC meetings, for use in your favorite calendaring app: [iCalendar Meeting Schedule](/community/irc-meetings.ical)

Note that you should *subscribe* to this link, rather than *import* it,
because it is subject to change.

A [list of all meetings](#meeting-list) is available below.

## Logging

CentOS IRC channels and meetings are often logged using a [https://wiki.centos.org/SIGGuide#SIGGuide.2FSIGProcess.2FDailyWorkings.Meetbot_Commands](meeting bot), for the purpose of taking minutes.
You can find meeting minutes [here](http://www.centos.org/minutes/).

### Automotive SIG

* Monthly, in the third week, on Thursday at [1500 UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=15&amp;min=00&amp;sec=0) in #centos-meeting2
* Chair (to contact for more information): Jefro Osier-Mixon (JeffreyOsierMixon), acting
* [Link to Project Site](http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Automotive)
* The purpose of the Automotive SIG is two-fold. First, it is meant to be a neutral public space for collaboration between third parties interested in open development of software targeted at in-vehicle automotive use cases. Second, it is meant to provide such projects with build and test infrastructure. (This second purpose is, as we understand it, common to many SIGs)

The goal of the SIG is to provide an open-source home for RHEL-oriented automotive work, and to attract and encourage open development of automotive software between commercial and non-commercial partners.

Please join us!
