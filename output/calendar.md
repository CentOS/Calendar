## Meeting schedule

The meetings schedule is driven by the [github.com/CentOS/Calendar](https://github.com/CentOS/Calendar) repository.
To propose a change or add a meeting, please submit a pull request to that repository.
This repository is mirrored to git.centos.org.

The calendar is also available as an `.ical` file containing all CentOS IRC meetings, for use in your favorite calendaring app: [iCalendar Meeting Schedule](/community/irc-meetings.ical)

Note that you should *subscribe* to this link, rather than *import* it,
because it is subject to change.

A [list of all meetings](#meeting-list) is available below.

## Logging

### Automotive SIG

* Monthly, in the first week, on Wednesday at [1400 UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=14&amp;min=00&amp;sec=0) in #google-meet
* Chair (to contact for more information): Jefro Osier-Mixon (JeffreyOsierMixon), acting
* [Link to Project Site](http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Automotive)
* The purpose of the Automotive SIG is two-fold. First, it is meant to be a neutral public space for collaboration between third parties interested in open development of software targeted at in-vehicle automotive use cases. Second, it is meant to provide such projects with build and test infrastructure. (This second purpose is, as we understand it, common to many SIGs)

The goal of the SIG is to provide an open-source home for RHEL-oriented automotive work, and to attract and encourage open development of automotive software between commercial and non-commercial partners.

Please join us!

We are a non vendor, non technology and non agent specific focus group, but we will gladly work with and build content to suit relevant niches or vendor ecosystems. This group specifically targets users who wish to install and run their own, independent ( or hybrid ) cloud infrastructure on CentOS.

The CCS intends to take ownership of existing CentOS Project relationships with vendors, and help to maintain the updated package repositories for all participating cloud projects.
