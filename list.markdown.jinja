## Meeting schedule

The meetings schedule is driven by the [github.com/CentOS/Calendar](https://github.com/CentOS/Calendar) repository.
To propose a change or add a meeting, please submit a pull request to that repository.
This repository is mirrored to git.centos.org.

The calendar is also available as an `.ical` file containing all CentOS IRC meetings, for use in your favorite calendaring app: [iCalendar Meeting Schedule](/community/irc-meetings.ical)

Note that you should *subscribe* to this link, rather than *import* it,
because it is subject to change.

A [list of all meetings](#meeting-list) is available below.

## Logging

Meetings are often logged using the Fedora meeting bot for the purpose of taking minutes.

* View all [meeting minutes](https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/).
* Learn how the [Hyperscale SIG uses meetbot](https://sigs.centos.org/hyperscale/communication/meetings/).
