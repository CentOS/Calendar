    The CentOS Storage Special Interest Group (SIG) is a collection of like-minded
    individuals coming together to ensure that CentOS is a suitable platform for
    many different storage solutions. This group will ensure that all Open
    Source storage options seeking to utilize CentOS as a delivery platform have
    a voice in packaging, orchestration, deployment, and related work.
    We meet monthly on the first Tuesday of the month.
