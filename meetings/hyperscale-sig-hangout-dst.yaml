    Monthly Hyperscale SIG hangout (Zoom VC, not IRC): https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84411093900?pwd=RUxKUFAxVlJnQWVMODhobThLU3BHdz09
    The Hyperscale SIG focuses on enabling CentOS Stream deployment on large-scale infrastructures and facilitating collaboration on packages and tooling. This is a monthly VC to work together on a common project, ask questions, or just hang out. This occurs on the third Wednesday of each month. If Zoom asks for a passcode, use 550255 (the meeting ID is 844 1109 3900).
