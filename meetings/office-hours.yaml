    Come join us for an informal hour of discussion. Bring your concerns about the
    project, suggestions for changes, or offers of help. This is not a tech support
    hour but rather is about the running of the project itself. This
    meeting is monthly on the second Wednesday of each month. Speak up
    if you have anything to address.
