    The CentOS Virtualization Special Interest Group ( virt-sig ) is a group of
    people coming together to promote and use CentOS Linux as a base platform
    as a suitable platform for various virtualization efforts.
    This includes type-1 and type-2 hypervisors like Xen and KVM, containers
    and containment based technologies like LXC and other system and process
    level virtualization technologies in the future.
